1. The algorithm is pretty good at identifying the post-it note in that a good majority of it is in the red region. However, parts of the sky is also in the red region. This is probably due to the fact that the sky is more or less a solid white, and therefore it is likely for some parts of the sky to have a pretty similar patch lying nearby. 

2. The algorithm works better on the real2 images. A larger portion of the post-it note is in the red, while the red region outside of the post-it note is smaller. This occurs as there are smaller patches of a solid color, hence the algorithm is forced to actually match the pattern to find a similar patch, instead of getting tripped up by probability.
