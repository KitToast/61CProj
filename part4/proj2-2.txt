1. 
Medium with 6 slaves took: 1 min 36 Sec.
Medium with 12 Slaves took: 2 min 11 sec.
Large with 12 slaves took: 1 hour 8 minutes 5 seconds.

2. 
For 6 instances, the mean processing rate was 0.2588MB/s.
For 12 instances, the mean processing rate was 0.1897MB/s.

3. The 12 instances case actually took longer than the 6 instances case, by a factor of 1.36. 
Spark was not very good at parallelizing for this occasion, since it took more time for the 12 
instances case than the 6 instances case.
Yet, this is a case of strong scaling. While the total amount of bytes processed for the 6 and
12 slave cases were equal, the amount of data processed by each of the slaves for the 12 case
had decreased. Strong scaling is defined to be how solution time varies with the number 
of workers given a fixed problem size, and this is precisely what we examined, since the sum
of the data processed by the two instances do not vary. Weak scaling would have involved an increase
in the amount of data processed by each of the workers, and this is not the case. Any time increase
was most likely due to the overhead caused by parallelizing the task. 

4. Prices per GB for both medium cases was $2.74/GB. Price per GB for the large case was $0.36/GB.

5. We spent $2.72 for this project, resulting from 4 hours of usage, rounded up.
